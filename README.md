# CS61A
This repo collects my labs, homework, and projects for the [UC Berkeley CS61A, Summer 2024](https://cs61a.org/) course.

## Materials
### Course slides

## Using `Ok`
Test the homework assignments, labs, and projects with `ok`.
```bash
cd /path/to/dir
python3 ok --local -q [functionName] -v
```
- `--local`: disable network activity to avoid authentication for users without enrolled.
- `-q`: run tests for a specific question
- `-v`: show all tests up to failing line (if any)

To get an assignment score.
```bash
python3 ok --local --score
```
