# Required Questions

## Q1: A Plus Abs B
Python's `operator` module contains two-argument functions such as `add` and `sub` for Python's built-in arithmetic operators. For example, `add(2, 3)` evalutes to 5, just like the expression `2 + 3`.

Fill in the blanks in the following function for adding `a` to the absolute value of `b`, without calling `abs`. You may **not** modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks.

```python
def a_plus_abs_b(a, b):
    """Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.

    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, 3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, -3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, 4)
    3
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, -4)
    3
    """
    if b < 0:
        f = _____
    else:
        f = _____
    return f(a, b)
```

Use Ok to test your code:
```bash
python3 ok -q a_plus_abs_b
```
Use Ok to run the local syntax checker (which checks that you didn't modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks):
```bash
python3 ok -q a_plus_abs_b_syntax_check
```

## Q2: Two of Three
Write a function that takes three positive numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two smallest numbers. **Use only a single line for the body of the function.**

```python
def two_of_three(i, j, k):
    """Return m*m + n*n, where m and n are the two smallest members of the
    positive numbers i, j, and k.

    >>> two_of_three(1, 2, 3)
    5
    >>> two_of_three(5, 3, 1)
    10
    >>> two_of_three(10, 2, 8)
    68
    >>> two_of_three(5, 5, 5)
    50
    """
    return _____
```
> Hint: Consider using the `max` or `min` function:
> ```python
> >>> max(1, 2, 3)
> 3
> >>> min(-1, -2, -3)
> -3
> ```

Use Ok to test your code:
```bash
python3 ok -q two_of_three
```
Use Ok to run the local syntax checker (which checks that you used only a single line for the body of the function):
```bash
python3 ok -q two_of_three_syntax_check
```

## Q3: Largest Factor
Write a function that takes an integer `n` that is **greater than 1** and returns the largest integer that is smaller than `n` and evenly divides `n`.

```python
def largest_factor(n):
    """Return the largest factor of n that is smaller than n.

    >>> largest_factor(15) # factors are 1, 3, 5
    5
    >>> largest_factor(80) # factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40
    40
    >>> largest_factor(13) # factor is 1 since 13 is prime
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Hint: To check if `b` evenly divides `a`, use the expression `a > % b == 0`, which can be read as, "the remainder when > dividing `a` by `b` is 0."

Use Ok to test your code:
```bash
python3 ok -q largest_factor
```

## Q4: Hailstone
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach*, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

The number `n` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of `n` is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name `n`, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at `n`, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:

```python
def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    >>> b = hailstone(1)
    1
    >>> b
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Hailstone sequences can get quite long! Try 27. What's the longest you can find?

> Note that if `n == 1` initially, then the sequence is one step long.
> Hint: If you see 4.0 but want just 4, try using floor division `//` instead of regular division `/`.

Use Ok to test your code:
```bssh
python3 ok -q hailstone
```

In 2019, there was a major [development](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/) in understanding how the hailstone conjecture works for most numbers!
